=== UART Timing Analysis for Logic Analyzer ===
Clock Frequency: 125 MHz
UART Baud Rate: 115200 bps
Bit Period: 8680.56 ns (8.68 us)
Start Bit Duration: 8.68 us
Data Bit Duration: 8.68 us each (8 bits = 69.44 us)
Stop Bit Duration: 8.68 us
Total Frame Time: ~86.8 us

=== Recommended Logic Analyzer Settings ===
Sampling Rate: At least 10x baud rate = 1.152 MHz minimum
Recommended: 10-20 MHz for clear capture
Trigger: Edge trigger on FALLING edge of RX (start bit)
Time Base: 10-20 us/div to see complete frame
Pre-trigger: 10-20% to see idle state before transmission
