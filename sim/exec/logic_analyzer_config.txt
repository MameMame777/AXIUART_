=== Logic Analyzer Configuration for 125MHz Sampling ===

System Configuration:
- FPGA Clock: 125 MHz
- Logic Analyzer Sampling: 125 MHz
- UART Baud Rate: 115200 bps

Timing Analysis:
- Sampling Period: 8 ns (125MHz)
- UART Bit Period: 8680.56 ns (115200 baud)
- Samples per UART bit: 8680.56ns / 8ns = 1085 samples
- This is EXCELLENT resolution for UART capture!

Problem Analysis:
- RX≠1 trigger doesn't work because:
  1. UART RX idles at logic HIGH (1)
  2. Only goes LOW (0) during start bits
  3. Current trigger condition is inverted

SOLUTION - Correct Trigger Settings:
1. Change trigger to: RX falling edge (1→0 transition)
2. Or use level trigger: RX = 0
3. Set pre-trigger to 10% to see idle state
4. Capture depth: at least 200μs to see complete transactions
